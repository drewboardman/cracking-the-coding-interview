* Big O is also known as *asymptotic runtime*

Airplane Example
----------------
* Electronic Transfer is `O(s)`:
    - `s` is the size of the file
    - this is linear, it increases with the size of the file
* Airplane is `O(1)`:
    - the time it takes is a constant
    - the size of the file doesn't matter at all
